#DEPRECATED, Mojang has now made MS accounts mandatory! Will not work!

To use, edit yggdrasil.py with your preferred editor for Python files to use your username and password. Running it as is will not work, as the username and password are "abcd"
Please note you need Python 2 for this to work. It does not work with Python 3.
